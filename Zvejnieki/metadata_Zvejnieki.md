## Other comments:
- Be aware of multiple graves! Not in every case grave goods can be assigned to a specific individual inside the grave. Information considering the grave (depth, etc.) doubles for multiple graves. Use the columns "grab_ID" (through ID repetition) or "anzahl_bestattungen" (>1) to rule out multiple graves.
- Grave goods are recorded as frequencies. Please note, that this might cause trouble in some statistics.
