Other comments:
  Be aware of multiple graves! 
    - Not in every case grave goods can be assigned to a specific individual inside the grave.
    - Information condsidering the grave (depth, etc.) doubles for multiple graves.
    - Use the colunms "grab_ID" (through ID repetition) or "anzahl_bestattungen" (>1) to rule out multiple graves.
  Grave goods are recorded as frequencies. Please note, that this might cause trouble in some statistics.
